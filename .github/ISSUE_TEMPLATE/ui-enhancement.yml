        ## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Hints
        
        **For the developer implementing this:**
        - Frontend files are in `src/static/` - `index.html`, `app.js`, and `styles.css`
        - Current design uses CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
        - Existing responsive design breakpoints should be maintained
        - Consider accessibility standards (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
        - Test on different screen sizes and devices
        
        **Technical Context:**
        - The site uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
        - CSS follows a component-based approach with clear class naming
        - JavaScript handles dynamic content loading and user interactions
        - Keep performance in mind - avoid heavy libraries unless absolutely necessary
