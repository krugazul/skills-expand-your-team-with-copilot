        ## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Hints
        
        **For the developer implementing this:**
        - Add the new activity to the `initial_activities` dictionary in `src/backend/database.py`
        - Follow the existing format with schedule_details including days array and start_time/end_time in 24-hour format
        - Ensure the activity appears in the appropriate filters on the frontend
        - Test that students can register and unregister properly
        
        **Technical Context:**
        - Activities are stored in MongoDB with a specific schema
        - Frontend filtering relies on schedule_details structure
        - Maximum participants should be enforced in the signup endpoint
