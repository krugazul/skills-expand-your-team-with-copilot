        ## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Hints
        
        **For the developer implementing this:**
        - Consider if this feature requires database schema changes
        - Evaluate if external services (email, PDF generation) are needed
        - Plan for error handling and user feedback
        - Consider security and privacy implications
        - Think about mobile responsiveness and accessibility
        - Estimate complexity and break into smaller tasks if needed
        
        **Technical Context:**
        - Backend: FastAPI with MongoDB database
        - Frontend: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
        - Current features: activity management, user authentication, student registration
        - Keep the system simple and maintainable
        - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
