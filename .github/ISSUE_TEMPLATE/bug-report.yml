        ## üí° Investigation Hints
        
        **For the developer investigating this:**
        - Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
        - Look at network requests to see if API calls are failing (F12 ‚Üí Network)
        - Verify database state if the issue involves data inconsistency
        - Test on different browsers and devices to isolate the problem
        - Check server logs for backend errors
        
        **Common areas to investigate:**
        - `src/static/app.js` for frontend logic errors
        - `src/backend/routers/` for API endpoint issues
        - `src/backend/database.py` for data-related problems
        - `src/static/styles.css` for display/layout issues
