        ## üí° Implementation Hints
        
        **For the developer implementing this:**
        - Modify the activity in the `initial_activities` dictionary in `src/backend/database.py`
        - If changing schedule, update both the human-readable schedule and schedule_details object
        - Ensure time format is consistent (24-hour format for start_time/end_time)
        - If increasing max_participants, no additional validation needed
        - If decreasing max_participants, check that current participants don't exceed new limit
        - Test that filters still work correctly after changes
        
        **Technical Context:**
        - Schedule changes affect frontend filtering logic
        - Participant changes may require manual intervention in the database
        - Activity name changes require updating the activity key in the database
